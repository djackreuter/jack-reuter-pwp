		<h1>Milestone 1</h1>
		<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> My personal website will be an online portfolio showcasing the work I've done as
			a developer in order to help me gain employment from a company</p>
		<p><strong>Audience:</strong> This site will be set up and designed for potential employers, hiring managers,
			and/or senior developers.</p>
		<p><strong>Goals:</strong> The goal of this site is to act as a gallery to showcase my work to potential
			employers in order to gain full time employment.</p>
		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<p><strong>Name:</strong> John Johnson</p>
		<p><strong>Age:</strong> 42</p>
		<p><strong>Profession:</strong> John Johnson owns abqwebdevs.com, a software development company in
			Albuquerque, NM. John's company assists business and organizations by developing software and
			building websites to help them grow their businesses and develop a stronger online presence. Abq Web Devs
			has been around for five years and has been doing quite well. </p>
		<p><strong>Technology: </strong> John is a Mac user and has a Macbook pro along with a slightly dated iPhone
			6s. His office runs on a high speed wireless internet connection.</p>
		<p><strong>Attitudes &amp; Behaviors</strong> John wants to be sure that he selects the right candidate. He
			has not hired anyone in over a year and wants to be absolutely certain that he hires the right person for the
			job. He wants to hire a junior developer within the next two weeks. John has been
			looking at resumes and online portfolio sites for about 15 minutes each day for the past week.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Frustrations &amp; Needs</strong> John wants to hire an entry level full-stack developer to join
			his team so experience isn't everything. He wants someone that is highly motivated and eager to learn, that
			also has a solid foundation of both frontend and backend technologies that can be built on. John is
			focusing on the whole package regarding the online portfolios of the candidates that have
			applied. He is looking at the appearance and functionality of the candidates website, as well as the
			projects it contains. So far he has not found anybody that has both an impressive resume, online portfolio, and
			the right personality and soft skills to match. He has been looking at multiple candidates resumes and
			portfolio sites everyday for a
			week. With his two week deadline fast approaching, he is starting to think that his ideal candidate
			might not exist.</p>
		<p><strong>Goals:</strong> John's main concern is whether or not a potential candidate has the appropriate
			foundation of knowledge and appropriate skills to be a valuable employee. John looks at the
			candidates websites and know after 5 min of browsing the content, and judging the appearance of the overall
			site, if this candidate is worthy of an interview. He is paying close attention to the functionality of the
			site and thinks that it is a good way to get an idea of each developers skills and attention to detail.
			John wants to find a site that is easy to navigate, has seamless functionality, and is not over complicated
			for the user. If the site is too difficult to figure out how to navigate, John will spend no more than 30
			seconds on it, cross that applicants name off the list and move on to the next one.</p>
		<p><strong>Use Case:</strong> It's Monday morning and John is looking over resumes and online
			portfolio sites on his Macbook and getting ready to contact the candidates he believes would be a good fit for
			the job. John comes across my resume and thinks that I look good on paper and he decides to look at my personal
			website as well. John notices the professional layout of my site right away and has no problem navigating to
			the different areas on the page. He likes the responsiveness of the site and has a look at the projects section
			to see what else I've done. Still impressed after seeing what projects I've worked on, John decides to put me
			down as a candidate to interview. He wants to set up in-person interviews on Tuesday and Wednesday so that
			he can make his decision on who he wants to hire by the weekend. He has a total of 7 candidates to interview
			starting at 10am Tuesday morning. He will interview 4 candidates on Tuesday and the remaining 3 on Wednesday.
