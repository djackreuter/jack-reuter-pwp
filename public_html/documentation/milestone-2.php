		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
		<h3>Header</h3>
		<p>The header of the site will contain my name and also contain four navigation
			buttons horizontally across the bottom that will direct the user to that section of the page when clicked.
			The header will remain fixed at the top of the page. The navigation buttons will be:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Home
			</li>
			<li>
				About
			</li>
			<li>
				Projects
			</li>
			<li>
				Contact
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Main Content</h3>
		<p>The <em>Home</em> section will essentially be the top of the page. It will and have a picture of me working
			on my laptop and a quote over the image. The idea of the picture will be to show employers that I am an
			active developer</p>
		<p>The <em>About</em> button will bring the user to a section containing a bio about me. It will contain a
			small picture of me at the as well as a summary of me on both a personal and professional level. The idea
			behind this is to give employers an idea of who I am outside the scope of a resume.</p>
		<p>The <em>Projects</em> button will bring the user to a section containing a gallery of projects that I've
			done. It will contain the capstone, as well as other development projects. It will be used to showcase my
			skills and capabilities to potential employers. It will also show employers all the projects I have been apart
			of.</p>
		<p>The <em>Contact</em> button will bring the user to the bottom of the page that will contain a contact form.
			The form will be in place for a potential employer to contact me easily.</p>
		<h3>Footer</h3>
		<p>The last section will be the footer at the very bottom. This will contain links to my LinkedIn profile,
			Twitter account, and GitHub profile. This will allow a potential employer to be able to find other relevant
			sites about me without having to do additional searching.</p>
