## Milestone 1 Feedback

Amazing job on Milestone 1. Your directory structure is perfect, so is your HTML, and the gitignore has no mistakes. You also did a great job of laying out the persona and use-case. I was able to easily see who would be using the site and how they would be interacting with it. You have a great understanding the documentation stage of creating a site which will serve you well in the future.

## Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
Excellent work - what you've created here will serve you as an effective guide for your upcoming development phase. Your content strategy is well thought through, and your wireframes are good. HTML looks great.

Use caution when formatting your horizontal nav links on mobile screens. The amount of horizontal space across some smaller mobile screens can be quite limited (such as on older iPhones) - so keep this in mind. Any more than 4 links I would consider using a collapsing navigation solution on small screens.

The Bootstrap navbar does not support centering links, so explore mobile-friendly alternatives. I came across a CSS solution that could work well for you, with some additional modifications: https://codepen.io/davidcochran/pen/rcHae

You'll probably want to use the Scrollspy JavaScript component as well. This JavaScipt/jQuery plugin will highlight the nav link of the section a user is currently on. Documentation can be found here: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy

The Bootstrap thumbnail component might be a useful, albeit simple, solution for your gallery items. If you're looking for something a bit "more" - the Codrops blog has some stunning (and more advanced) ideas that might be worth a try: https://tympanus.net/codrops/ and https://tympanus.net/Development/HoverEffectIdeas/. Use these with caution however - some featured effects on this blog are somewhat "experimental".

I recommend FontAwesome for iconography, and Google Fonts for custom typography.

We will be covering the wiring of the contact form in the weeks to come. In the meantime, build out the form using Bootstrap. The full form wiring documentation is here if you'd like to read ahead: https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/jquery-validated-captcha-form/

Your Milestone 2a passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are clear to begin development on your PWP. You'll want to build your PWP page in the following location: `public_html/index.php`, and the next Milestone will be a mid-development checkin. Nice work!
