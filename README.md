## Feedback

 Amazing job on Milestone 1. Your directory structure is perfect, so is your HTML, and the gitignore has no mistakes. You also did a great job of laying out the persona and use-case. I was able to easily see who would be using the site and how they would be interacting with it. You have a great understanding the documentation stage of creating a site which will serve you well in the future.
